## Timestamp to ago string.

A small util for converting a timestamp to a string. Pass in a timestamp and get a string back that says how long ago it was.

n example could be, "interacted 5 seconds ago".

- "XX seconds ago"
- "XX minutes ago"

- "XX weeks ago"

- "XX years ago"

Of course you can change the outcoming sting as you please in the end of the time.tsx file.

Code coverage can be found in the coverage folder which is created once running the tests.
